Task 2 - testing

Your task is to design tests that would ensure that the functionality
implemented by a custom *concurrent* data structure (MultiQueue) is correct. 

The abstract interface of the queue is provided in task2.MultiQueue, the
abstract interface should not be modified. No actual implementation of the queue
is provided and you should treat the queue as black box.

Due to the scope of this task the test suite should only check for the
correctness of the methods and their implementation, there's no need to test for
statistical properties of dequeued entries or to do any performance tests. 

The queue is assumed to be used in a multi-threaded setting in a performance
oriented environment.

For this task the priorities are
  1) being correct.
  2) being readable.

Hints and tips:
  * An empty scalatest class skeleton was provided.
